# EcoSphere - Interactive Ecosystem Simulator

Welcome to **EcoSphere**, a visually stunning and highly interactive web-based ecosystem simulator. Build and manage virtual ecosystems, observe dynamic interactions, and explore educational insights about nature.

## üöÄ Features

### **Interactive Canvas**
- Add plants, animals, and water sources by clicking on the canvas.
- Drag-and-drop functionality to place and rearrange ecosystem elements.
- Smooth animations for element placement and interactions.

### **Dynamic Ecosystem Simulation**
- Real-time behaviors like predation, growth, reproduction, and resource depletion.
- The ecosystem reacts dynamically to user changes and natural processes.

### **Climate Control**
- Sliders for weather effects, including sunlight, rainfall, and temperature.
- Visualize these effects with beautiful animations like raindrops and sunlight rays.

### **User Feedback**
- Toast notifications provide real-time updates on user actions and ecosystem events.
- Simulation status with detailed explanations of ecosystem health and interactions.

### **Save & Reload**
- Placeholder save/load functionality using local storage (to be fully implemented).
- Save your ecosystem progress and continue building later.

### **Responsive Design**
- Optimized layout for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## üõ† Technologies Used
